## CRUD application with Vite and JavaScript :rocket:

***

##
This application is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system developed in JavaScript using Vite as the development environment. 
The application manages a list of financial records with the following fields:

* :star: **ID: Unique identifier of the record.**
* :star: **Balance: Saldo financiero asociado al registro.**
* :star: **FirstName: Name of the record holder.**
* :star: **LastName: Last name of the record holder**
* :star: **Active: Registration activation status.**
* :star: **Actions: Actions available for each record, including "Select" and "Delete."**
      
Users can perform the following operations:

1. **Create new record**:  Add entries to the list with a form that captures the necessary information.
2. **Read existing records**:  View the complete list of records with their respective details.
3. **Update Records**:  Modify the details of an existing record, including the ability to change the activation status.
4. **Delete records**:  Delete selected records from the list.

The app uses Vite to streamline development and provide a quick development experience. 
The user interface is intuitively designed with action buttons for each record, facilitating CRUD operations efficiently.

This project is a lightweight and hassle-free implementation to manage financial data easily and quickly, taking advantage of Vite for efficient development.
